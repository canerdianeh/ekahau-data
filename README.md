Ekahau Data Manipulation Code

Here you'll find scripts for fiddling with Ekahau data files to do things that are either impossible within the Ekahau application, or are a tedious manual process. 

## Update_APs.py
based on a lab file from WiFiAcademy, this takes a list of BSSIDs from a CSV and updates AP names, models, ESSIDs, as well as adding key/value tags for AP groups, AP serial numbers, AP Wired MAC addresses, and anything else you want. Can be used in conjunction with my Aruba API scripts for pulling BSS table and AP Database.
